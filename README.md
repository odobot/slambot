## :hammer: How to build
To build the packages in this repository follow these steps:
1. `cd` into an existing or create a new [workspace](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Creating-A-Workspace/Creating-A-Workspace.html)
   ```console
   mkdir -p slambot/src
   ```
2. clone this repository in the `src` folder of your workspace
   ```console
   cd slambot/src
   ```
   ```console
   git clone https://github.com/odobot/slambot.git
   ```
3. Naviage back to the workspace folder
   ```console
   cd ../
   ```
4. build the workspace using the [colcon](https://colcon.readthedocs.io/en/released/reference/verb/build.html) build tool
   ```console
   colcon build --symlink-install
   ```
5. source the `setup.bash` file
   ```console
   source install/setup.bash
   ```
6. You can add the `setup.bash` file on the bashrc script file, just open the file and add it at end:
    ```console
    gedit ~/.bashrc
    ```
    ```console
    source ~/slambot/install/setup.bash
    ```
## :movie_camera: Rviz
To view the urdf in rviz open 3 terminals:
<br>
On the first terminal (needs to the terminal you sourced your setup.bash file in) type: 
```console
  ros2 launch slambot robot_description.launch.py
  ```
Second terminal
 ```console
  rviz2
  ```
In rviz for the Fixed frame use `base_link` add RobotModel at the Displays under the robot model there is Description topic add `/robot_description`.

Third terminal
 ```console
  ros2 run joint_state_publisher_gui joint_state_publisher_gui
 ```

## ðŸŽ¥ Gazebo
To launch your robot arm in gazebo, run:
 ```console
  ros2 launch slambot gazebo.launch.py
  ```
